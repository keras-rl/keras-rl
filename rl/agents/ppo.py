    Single threaded implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, using an A2C (Advantage

    Note on network architecture
    ============================
    The actor network should take as input a window of recent states, and should output a vector in the abstract
    sample space as defined by the user, which is then feed into the sampler, again supplied
    by the user. This sampler (instance of interface ``ProbabilityDistribution``) is responsible for
    transforming the abstract sample space into actual value in the action space, through a (known,
    fixed) random distribution, by calling ``self.sampler.sample``.
    The actor network can have dummy inputs. An example use case would be to act as the source of
    trainable parameter independent from the network, such as the noise level/volatility to add to output.
    In such case all but one of the multiple inputs of the network must be dummy, and the index of the
    actual (sole) input (as occur in ``network.inputs``) should be specified through ``actor_input_index``.
    The critic network have the same input as actor, and should output a scalar representing estimated
    value of this state.

    Algorithm
    =========
    TODO

    Internal design
    ===============
    First, we replaced the usual ``Memory`` class with our own ``EpisodeMemory`` to deal with the unique
    demand in this scenario. In particular, we need to deal with windowing, and more importantly the
    custom objective function contains a value (Advantage Estimate) that is derived from the state transitions
    in a rather non-trivial way - this is handled by leaving ``windowed_state`` and ``advantage`` blank until
    the very end of the episode, upon which we do all the computations (which information-theoretically do
    depends on the entire episode anyway), to recover all values and fill it in via ``_complete_episode``.
    Another intrinsic difference is that in the basic framework any individual datum in the experience
    replay buffer is disposable, which is not true in A2C since we perform training in batch here. (Aside
    from the need to retain data to derive the missing info) Hence we also use our own buffer implementation
    called ``FixedBuffer``. This works because PPO uses the GAE which has a fixed size lookahead that is known
    statically.

    As for the A2C framework itself, we use the attribute ``self.episode_memories`` to hold the memories/buffers -
    one for each concurrent actor, so it is a python list of ``EpisodeMemory``. Since this is a single-threaded
    implementation, we will still adhere to the framework of the base class ``Agent``, and only simulate the
    concurrency via round-robin execution. To be precise, as we simulate many runs using the actor network,
    the information of each episode will be saved to each concurrent actor one by one. One batch mode training
    will occur each time a full round is completed - that is, when each concurrent actor has saved one new episode.
    When this happen we aggregate the (new) episodes from each actors into a big, fixed data set, which is then
    feed to the training algorithm for some iterations. (this ensure information efficiency by making sure the
    learning value in those episodes are more fully exploited) After that, both networks are updated, the
    data sets and all buffers are cleared, and we begin anew.

    :param actor: Actor network, input shape ``(window_length, dimensions of observation space)``. (Keras' own batch dimension is implicit as usual)
    :param actor_input_index: Index of the actual/non-dummy input to the actor network as occur in ``network.inputs``. Ignored if there is only one input.
    :param critic: Critic network, input shape ``(window_length, dimensions of observation space)``. (Keras' own batch dimension is implicit as usual)
    :param memory: ``Memory`` object to hold a history of simulation run. As opposed to other agents, we only use it superficially as replay buffer is not used in A2C architecture.
    :param sampler: User supplied sampler, should be an instance of the interface ``ProbabilityDistribution``. See notes above for explanation of its role.
    :param batch_size: Minibatch size used during training.
    :param epsilon: Cutoff for the clipped loss function
    :param nb_actor: Number of concurrent actors running simulation (They are still executed sequential in this version)
    :param nb_steps: Number of steps to run in each simulation episode before termination. Should match with xx in yy
    :param epoch: Number of training epoch for the actor network.
    :param gamma: Parameter gamma for the GAE.
    :param lamb: Parameter lamb for the GAE.
